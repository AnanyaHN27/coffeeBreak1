Are you paying attention?Good.If you're not listeningcarefully you will miss things.Important things.I will not pause,I will not repeat myselfand you will not interrupt me.If you think thatbecause you're sitting where you areand I am sitting where I amthat you are in controlof what is about to happen,you 're mistaken.I am in control,because I know thingsthat you do not know.Manchester Police Department.Please hold.Looks like a break-in.Residence of Turing, A/an.Window's broken. Home 's been ransacked.Send a detective down, will you?What/ will need from you nowis a commitment.You will listen closely and you will notjudge me until I am Hnished.If you cannot commit to this,then please leave the room.Come in.But if you choose to stay,remember; you chose to be here.What happens from this momentforward is not my responsibility.It's yours.Pay attention.What's all this, then?Turing, Alan.Professor at King's.- Seems to have been a burglary.- Oh? What of?Well, that's just it.Nothing missing, really.What's he doing in Manchester?Something with machines.The project at the NPL.I checkedbut he won't say what it's on.Professor Turing?Detective Nock, Manchester Police.Sergeant Staehl here tells meyou had a burglary last night.Professor Turing?Take a step backand don't breathe heavily.- Breathe?- Undiluted cyanide.It wouldn't take morethan a thimbleful to kill you.Ah.- Disappointing.- Pardon?I had hoped for a bit more.Sergeant Staehl, is it just me or do youget the sense that we're being insulted?Last night you had a break-in.Your neighbour Mr Springborncalled to report the noise.He said there was quite a ruckus.Only you say nothing was taken.It's odd.So how about you tell us what happenedand we'll find the chap who did this.Gentlemen,I don't believe that you could findthe chap that did thisif he walked up to youand spat in your face.What I could use right now is nota bobby but a really good cleaning lady.So unless one of you has an apronin your car,I suggest you tile your reportsand leave me alone.As you say, Professor Turing.Best of luck with your cyanide.I'll give you a quid if youcan name me a more insufferable sod.Seemed a bit forced, though, didn't it?Don't know what you mean.Well, if you didn'twant a pair of bobbiesdigging around in your personal affairs,that'd have been a stellar wayto make sure they don't.Tell me you don't thinkthis is suspicious.I don't think this is suspicious.A mysterious professor who won't admithe's had something stolenfrom his house?I think Alan Turing's hiding something.War declared!800,000 children evacuated!German bombs on their way!Get your papers here.Fresh off the press.War declared!800,000 children evacuated!German bombs expected soon!Get your papers here.Fresh off the press.This morning,the British Ambassador in Berlinhanded the German governmenta Hnal note,stating that un/ess we heard from themby 11 o'clock,a state of war would exist between us.I have to tell you nowthat no such undertakinghas been received.And that consequentlythis country is at war with Germany.For the second timein the lives of most of us,We afe at WalfWe have tried to #nda peaceful way out...Papers, please.- What are you doing here?- Uh, the lady told me to wait.In my office?Did she tell you to help yourself to teawhile you were here?Uh... No, she didn't.She obviously didn't tell youwhat a joke was then, either, I gather?Was she supposed to?- Who are you?- Alan Turing.- Ah, Turing. The mathematician.- Correct.However could I have guessed?You didn't.You just read it on that piece of paper.King's College, Cambridge.Now it says here you were a bitof a prodigy in the Maths Department.I'm not sure I can evaluate that, Mr...- How old are you, Mr Turing?- Uh, 27.And how old were you when youbecame a fellow at Cambridge?Twenty-four.And how old were youwhen you published this paperthat has a titlethat I can barely understand?Uh, 23.And you don't think that qualifies youas a certified prodigy?Well, Newton discovered Binomial Theoremaged 22.Einstein wrote four papers that changedthe world by the age of 26.As far as I can tell, I've...I've barely made par.- My God, you're serious.- Would you prefer I made a joke?Oh, I don't think you knowwhat those are.Hardly seems fairthat that's a requirementfor employment here, Mr...Commander Denniston, Royal Navy.All right, Mr Turing, I'll bite.Why do you wish to workfor His Majesty's Government?Oh, I don't, really.Are you a bleeding pacifist?I'm agnostic about violence.But you do realise that 600 milesaway from Londonthere's this nasty little chapcalled Hitlerwho wants to engulf Europe in tyranny?Politics isn't really my areaof expertise.Really?Well, I believeyou've just set the recordfor the shortest job interviewin British military history.Oh, uh...Mother says I can beoff-putting sometimeson account of being one of the bestmathematicians in the world.- In the world?- Oh, yes.Do you know how many peopleI've rejected for this programme?- No.- That's right.Because we're a top secret programme.But I'll tell you,just because we're friends,that only last week I rejectedone of our great nation's top linguists.Knows German better than Bertolt Brecht.- I don't speak German.- What?I don't speak German.Well, how the hell are you supposedto decrypt German communicationsif you don't...I don't know, speak German?Well, I'm really quite excellentat crossword puzzles.Margaret!German codes are a puzzle.A game just like any other game.- Margaret, where are you?- I'm really very good at games,uh, puzzles.And this is the most difficult puzzlein the world.Margaret!For the love of God.This is a joke, obviously.I'm afraid I don't know what those are,Commander Denniston.Have a pleasant trip backto Cambridge, Professor.Enigma.You called for me?That's what you're doing here.The top secret programme at Bletchley.You're trying to breakthe German Enigma machine.What makes you think that?It's the greatest encryption devicein historyand the Germans use itfor all major communications.If the Allies broke Enigma, well,this would turn intoa very short war indeed.Of course that's what you're working on.You also haven't got anywhere with it.If you had, you wouldn't be hiringcryptographers out of university.You need me a lot more than I need you.I... I like solving problems, Commander.And Enigma is the most difficultproblem in the world.Oh, Enigma isn't difficult-It's impossible.The Americans,the Russians, the French,the Germans.Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.Good. Let me try,then we'll know for sure, won't we?Welcome to Enigma.The details of every surprise attack,every secret convoy,and every U-boat in the bloody Atlanticgo into that thingand outcomes gibberish.It's beautiful.It's the crooked hand of death itself.Our Wrens intercept thousandsof radio messages a day.And to the lovely young ladiesof the Women's Royal Navy,they're nonsense.It's only when you feed them backinto Enigma that they make any sense.But we have an Enigma machine.Yes, Polish Intelligencesmuggled it out of Berlin.So what's the problem?Just put the intercepted messagesback into the Enigma and...Look, it's not that simple. Is it?Just having an Enigma machinedoesn't help you to decode the messages.Very good, Mr Turing.To decode a message, you needto know the machine's settings.Now, the Germans switch settingsevery day, promptly at midnight.We usually intercept our first messagearound 6:0Oam.Which gives you exactly18 hours every day to crack the codebefore it changes and you start again.Five rotors. 10 plugboard cables.- That's one million...-1,000 million.- No, it's... I've got it.- It's a million million.Well, it's in the millions,obviously.There's over 150 million million millionpossible settings.Very good.One hundred and fifty-nine,if you want to be exact about it,1-5-9 with 18 zeros behind it.Possibilities.Every single day.Gentlemen,meet Hugh Alexander.I personally selected himto run this unit.Didn't you...Mr Alexander won Britain'snational chess championship.- Twice.- You're not the only onewho's good at games round here, Turing.Are we to work together, then?I prefer to have my own office.You're a team and you will work as one.I don't have time to explain myselfas I go alongand I'm afraid these menwould only slow me down.If you can't play together,then I'm afraidwe can't let you play at all.This is Stewart Menzies. MI6.There are only five divisionsof Military Intelligence.- There is no MIG.- Exactly.That's the spirit.Mr Turing, do you knowhow many British servicemen have diedbecause of Enigma?- Uh, no, I don't.- Three.While we've been havingthis conversation.Oh, look, there's another.I rather hope he didn't have a family.This war Commander Denniston'sbeen going on about,we're not winning it.Break the code,at least we have a chance.Shall we leave the children alonewith their new toy?All right, gentlemen...Let's play.The game was quite a simple one.Every single German message,every surprise attack,every bombing run,every, uh......imminent U-boat assault.They were all Heatingthrough the air.Radio signals that,well, any schoolboywith an AM kit could intercept.The trick was that they were encrypted.One hundred and fifty-ninemillion million millionpossible Enigma settings.All we had to do was try each one.But if we had 10 menchecking one setting a minutefor 24 hours every dayand seven days every week,how many days do you think it would taketo check each of the settings?It's not days, it's years.It's 20 million years.To stop a coming attack,we would have to check20 million years' worth of settingsin 20 minutes.I'm famished. Lunch?Good Lord, what is it about womenwith little hats?The boys...We're going to get some lunch.Alan?- Yes?- I said we're going to get some lunch.- Alan?- Yes?- Can you hear me?- Yes.I said we're off to get some...This is starting to geta little bit repetitive.What is?I had asked if you wantedto come to lunch with us.Er, no, you didn't.You said you were goingto get some lunch.Have I offended you in some way?Why would you think that?Would you like to cometo lunch with us?What time's lunchtime?- Christ, Alan, it's a bleeding sandwich.- What is?- Lunch.- I don't like sandwiches.Never mind.You know, to pull offthis irascible genius routine,one actually has to be a genius, Alan.And yet we're the onesmaking progress here, aren't we?You are?Yes, we are.We have decrypted a numberof German messagesby analysing the frequencyof letter distribution.Oh, even a broken clock is righttwice a day.That's not progress.That's just blind luck.I'm designing a machine that willallow us to break every message,every day, instantly.Who's hungry?- Let's go.- I'm hungry.- What?- Peter asked who was hungry.Can I have some soup, please?What do you mean, classified?No, I am aware of the literal meaningof the word "classified",what I'm asking iswhy would a maths professorhave his military records classified?Yeah, well, I will come down.Pardon me, I'd like to seesome documents, if I may.Service records of a MrTuring, Alan.Foreign Office sent me.This is unacceptable.If you wish to discuss a complaint,I suggest you make a proper appointment.Alexander... Complaint?No. No, Hugh Alexander has deniedmy requisition for parts and equipmentthat I need to build the machineI have designed.Your fellow code-breakersare refusing to work with youand they've filed a formal complaint.It is inspiredby an old Polish code machine,only this one isinfinitely more advanced.If you don't respond to the complaint,I shall have to take it upwith the Home Office.Put those files by my desk.Fine. My response is they're all idiots,fire them and use the savingsto fund my machine.I only need about 100,000.100,000?Why are you building a machine?it's highly technical,you wouldn't understand.I suggest you make the effort to try.Enigma is an extremelywell-designed machine.Our problem is thatwe're only using men to try to beat it.What if only a machinecan defeat another machine?Well, that's not very technical.Hugh Alexanderis in charge of your unit.He said no and that is that.I simply don't have time for this.Have you ever won a war, Turing?I have. Do you know how it's done?Order. Discipline. Chain of command.You're not at university any longer.You are a very small cogin a very large systemand you will doas your commanding officer instructs.Who... Who is your commanding officer?Winston Churchill,Number 10 Downing Street, London SW1.You have a problem with my decision,you can take it up with him.Mr Menzies. Mr Menzies!Are you going to London?- Possibly.- Would you deliver a letter for me?Look, I'm sorry, but are you joking?Churchill's put Alan in charge?- This is a terrible idea.- No, no, no...So I can give these men orders now?I hate to say it but yes.Excellent. Keith and Charles,you're both fired.- Excuse me?- What?You're mediocre linguistsand positively poor code-breakers.Alan, you can'tjust fireKeith and Charles.Well, he just said I could.No, I did no such thing.But Churchill did.Go to hell.Well, this is inhuman.Even for you.Popular at school, were you?The prob/em began, of course,with the carrots.The carrots are orange.The peas are green. They mustn't touch.Do you know why people like violence?It is because it feels good.Humans #nd violence deeply satisfying.But remove the satisfactionand the act becomes hollow.Turing?Come on.Don't be such a kike about it.Leave him to bloody rot.I didn? learn this on my own,of course-I had help.Christopher helped.Alan, are you all right?t's not my fault.The carrots got in with the peas and...I'm sorry, I won't let them do it again.They're getting worse.They only beat me upbecause I'm smarter than they are.No, they beat you upbecause you're different.- Mother says I'm just an odd duck.- And she's right.But you know, Alan,sometimes it's the very peoplewho no one imagines anything ofwho do the things no one can imagine.So what do we do now?- We're short on staff.- Well, we, uh, we get more staff, then.And how do you propose to do that?Erm, Alan Turingto see Stewart Menzies.Very good, sir.So who are they?Oh, all sorts, really.A teacher. An engineer.A handful of students.And you thinkthey're qualified for Bletchley'cause they're goodat crossword puzzles?Well, they say they're goodand now we shall find out, won't we?In order to aid your efforts,there is, to the right of you,a green scratch card book.You are to make notes in that.Gentlemen, you have six minutesin which to complete the puzzle,at which point I will...Pardon me, ma'am,this room's restricted.Oh, apologies for my tardiness.The bus caught a flat tyre.May I continue, please? Thank you.- You're not allowed in here, ma'am.- Oh, but I'm only a few minutes late...The secretaries are to head upstairs.This room's for the candidates.May I get on with this now, please?- Uh, I am a candidate.- For what position?The letter didn't say, precisely.Yes, the secretariesare to head upstairs.It did say that it was top secret.What is going on?I... I solved a crossword puzzlein the newspaperand I got this letter sayingthat I was a candidatefor some sort of mysterious job.My name's Joan Clarke.Miss, did you really solvethis puzzle yourself?What makes you thinkI couldn't solve the puzzle myself?I'm really very good at...Ma'am, I'll have to ask you to...Miss Clarke, I find tardinessunder any circumstance unacceptable.Take a seat so that we may continue.Thank you.Now, as I was saying,you have six minutesto complete the task in front of you.Erm, gentlemen, and lady...Begin.Six minutes.- Is that even possible?- No, no. Takes me eight.This isn't about crossword puzzles.It's about how one approachessolving an impossible problem.Do you tackle the whole thingat once or divide it into small...You've finished?Yes.Five minutes and 34 seconds.You said to do it in under six.Congratulations.My warmest welcometo His Majesty's Service.If you speak a wordof what I'm about to show you,you will be executed for high treason.You will lie to your friends,your familyand everyone you meetabout what it is you really do.And what is it that we're really doing?We're going to break an unbreakableNazi code and win the war.Oh.What's that you're reading?- it's about cryptography.- Like secret messages?Not secret. That's the brilliant part.Messages that anyone can seebut no one knows what they meanunless you have the key.How's that different from talking?- Talking?- When people talk to each other,they never say what they mean,they say something else.And you're expectedto just know what they mean.Only I never do.So...How's that different?Alan, I have a funny feelingyou're going to be very good at this.Goodnight, Alan.Goodnight.Careful, will you? It's not a toy.Funny. Looks like a toy.Bloody great 100,000 one.Your new minion's arrived.- Jack Good. We met...- Well, where's Miss Clarke?Lovely, isn't he?it's not just a usualhumdrum production mill factory.I mean, well, as I was saying,it's a very important radio factory.It's not, actually.On the spectrum of radiofactories, this one is particularly...Why are you not at Bletchley?Thank you so much for your visit,Mr Turing.- Was your trip pleasant?- Gather your things and let's go.I'm sorry but I'm unableto accept your offer.We feel that such a positionwould hardly be appropriate.You earned a double firstin mathematics.But sadly, wasn't grantedthe opportunity to become a fellow.You belong at Bletchley.I'm sorry, but for someonein my position to live, to...To work in a radio factoryso far from home,with all your men, erm, it would be...ndecorous.What in the world does that even mean?We have a group of young ladieswho tend to all of our clerical tasks.Assistants, translators.They live, erm, together in town.Would that bea more suitable environment?Hmm. So... So I would be workingamongst these women?Yes.Wonderful ladies.They even organise social eventsat St Martin's church down the road.Really, the whole thing is quite, er,um, decorous.Now, you won't haveproper security clearance, of course,so we'll have to improvise things a bit.Why are you helping me?Because there is only one thing thatmatters in this entire world right now,do you understand?And that is breaking Enigma.But... But Mr Turing...Why are you helping me?Oh, um...Sometimes it's the very peoplewho no one imagines anything ofwho do the thingsthat no one can imagine.Sir.- What this?- Alan Turing's classified military tile.- Bloody empty.- Exactly.- it's an empty manila envelope.- Yeah.You've cracked the case wide open, then,haven't you?Alan Turing's war recordsaren't just classified,they're non-existent.That means someone's got rid of them,erased them, burnt them.And that same person brokeinto his house and stole nothing?Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean.- What, the spies from the papers?- Soviet spies.But first they were professors,weren't they?Radicalised at Cambridge,then they joined the Communist Party,then the Foreign Office,then leaked information to Stalinduring the war.Now, can you think of anyone elsewe know who was at Cambridge,then took up something murkyand top secret when the war broke out?You think this Alan Turingmight be a Soviet agent?I think something very seriousis happening right here under our noses.Wouldn't you liketo rind out what it is?Welcome, ladies.If you'd like to follow me.Some people thoughtwe were at war with the Germans.Incorrect.We were at war with the clock.Britain was literally starving to death.The Americans sent over 100,000 tonnesof food every weekand every week the Germans wouldsend our desperately needed breadto the bottom of the ocean.Our daily failure was announcedat the chimes of midnight.And the sound would hauntour unwelcome dreams.Tick, tock.Tick.Damn it!- Whatjust happened?- Midnight.All the work we've done todayis useless.Oh, but don't worry, we've a few hoursbefore tomorrow's messagesstart flooding in,then we start all over again.- From scratch.- I'm so sick of this.Four hours rewiringhis plugboard matrix.Three hours yesterdayon his rotor positions.- Don't go over there.- Look, John, no.If this job wasn't already impossiblebefore, it bloody well is now.Hugh, don't.Damn you and your useless machine.My machine is how we are going to win.Really?This machine?Are you talking aboutthis bloody machine?- Hugh!- Hugh, don't! Don't!- Stop!- You arrogant bastard.You could help us.You could make this go fasterbut you won'tGet off.He's right, Alan.There are actual soldiers out theretrying to win an actual war.My brother protectsfood convoys in the Navy.My cousins fly RAF patrols.All my friends, they're all makinga difference while we justwhile away our days producing nothing.Because of you.My machine will work.Come on, Peter.Okay.Joan!Could you have made a bit more noise?I'm not quite sure my landlady woke up.- Oh, sorry.- Oh, uh, look.I think that's the best I can do.No male visitors after dark.- So, what did you bring me?- Erm...- There you go.- Here.Some men try flowers, you know.These are actual decrypted Enigmamessages direct from Nazi High Command."0600 hours, weather today is clear."Rain in the evening. Heil Hitler"Well, clearly that vital piece ofinformation is going to win us the war.t's the relationshipbetween the encryptedand decrypted messagesthat interests me.Can we find a clue herethat we can build into Christopher?- Who's Christopher?- Oh, he's my machine.You named him?Is that a bad name?No.No, never mind.Are you trying to buildyour universal machine?I read your paper at university.- Is it already being taught?- No.No. No, I was precocious.So, you theorised a machinethat could solve any problem?It didn't just do one thing,it did everything?It wasn't just programmable,it was re-programmable?Mmm.Is that your idea behind Christopher?Human brains can compute large sumsvery quickly, even Hugh can do that,but I want Christopher to be smarter.To make a calculationand then to determine what to do next.Like a person does.Think Of it.An electrical brain.A digital computer.Digital computer?Hmm.What's going on?What's happening?- No, no, no. Don't touch that.- Stay back.That's my desk.Thank goodness. I'd hate to thinkwe were searching the wrong one.What are you doing? What's going on?There is a spy in Bletchley Park.The Navy thinks that one of usis a Soviet double agent, Alan.Why?Our boys intercepted thison its way to Moscow.Look familiar?It's a Beale cipher.Encrypted with a phrase from a bookor a poem or...You...You don't seriously think I did this,do you?Double agents are such bastards.Isolated Ioners.No attachments to friends or family.Arrogant.Know anybody like that?Hmm. I know you don't like mebut that does not make me a Soviet spy.Nothing out of the ordinary, sir.Really? Hmm, all right.The Home Officemay be protecting you nowbut sooner or later,you will make a mistake.And I needn't bother firing you.They will hang you for treason.Hello.I heard about what happened.It's all the girls in Hut 3can talk about.I have an idea of whatmight cheer you up.So, because no letter can beencoded as itself,there's already a handful of settingsthat can be rejected at the outset.- Is that your team?- Uh, yes.- Shall we say hello?- No.Hello.I told you not to do that.Alan.- Uh, Hugh, hello.- Didn't know you drank.He doesn't, really.He just sort of sips at the foam.I'll let youinto a little secret, Miss...- Clarke.- Miss Clarke.- Please.- Foam's my favourite part, too.- Is it really?- Come and join us for a drink.- We'll be there in a moment.- Miss Clarke.Well, he likes you.- Yes.- You, uh...You got him to like you.- Yes.- Why?Because I'm a woman in a man's joband I don't have the luxuryof being an arse.Alan, it doesn't matterhow smart you are,Enigma is always smarter.If you really want to solve your puzzle,then you're going to needall the help you can getand they are not going to help youif they do not like you.What are those?- Apples.- No.Oh, they really are. Um, I'veWell, Miss Clarke...Joan, actually, um,said that it would be niceif I was to bring you all something.So here we are.- Thank you.- I like apples.My best to Miss Clarke.Uh, there are two people in a woodand, um, they run into a bear.The first person gets downon his knees to pray.The second personstarts lacing up his boots.The first person asks the second person,"My dear friend, what are you doing?You can't outrun a bear."To which the second person responds,"l don't have to,I only have to outrun you."I'll be with Christopherif anyone needs me.If we assume that thesquare root of two is a rational number,then we can say thatthe square root of two is A over B,where A and B are whole numbersand B is not zero.- Mr Turing, passing notes, are we?- No, sir.Only Turing would pass noteswritten in gibberish.All right, gentlemen.Do not forget your algebraover the break.Have a pleasant holiday.And we'll resume your irrationalswhen you return.Mmm.But Euler's Theoremgives you that immediately.Erm...Here, look at this.If you run the wires acrossthe plugboard matrix diagonally,it will eliminate rotor positions500 times faster.That's, uh,actually not an entirely terrible idea.I think that was Alan for "thank you".- That's my sandwich.- You don't like sandwiches.Are you nervous?What happens now?Well, it should work outthe day's Enigma settings.How long?The German Armyhas fanned out across Europe,from Poland to Serbia,Lithuania to Denmark, Norway to France.The Nazi flag now flies from morethan two dozen national capitals.Their campaign mounts in furyas a free Europe crumbles.Oh, it's still going.- Good morning, sir.- Morning, Margaret.Gears keep spinning on and on.Rotors on and on.it's endless.- With no result in sight?- No.Turing.Turing, open the bloody door.No. No.Open the door or we'll break it down.I can't let you in.I cannot let you interfere.Go on, then.Turn that thing off!No. Don't, please.Please, please, please!No. No, don't! No, no!Well, then, it seems that your greatbig expensive machine doesn't work.It does.Wonderful.So you've broken Enigma, then?It was just...Still working.This is my associatefrom the Home Office.You see,100,000 is rather a lot of moneyand he's here to seewhat you have to show for it.You will never understandthe importance of whatI am creating here!Have you decrypted any German messages?A single one?Can you point to anything at allthat you've achieved?Hmm.Your funding is upand our patience has expired.It's with such great pleasurethat I am finally able to say this.Alan Turing, you're fired.Please escort Mr Turingfrom the premises.No.I beg your pardon?If you fire Alan,well, then, you'll have to fire me, too.What on earth are you saying?Trust me when I tell you there is no onewho would rather say thisless than I do but...He's right. Alan is right.His machine can work and it's probablythe best chance that we've got.God, it's beyond belief.If you fire them,you'll have to fire me, too.And me.We're the bestcryptographic minds in Britain.Are you going to fire us all?Commander, at leastgive us some more time.Six months. And if the machine doesn'tproduce any results that we need,then we'll go back to doing thingsthe old way. How about that?One month.And then so help me God,you're all gone.Oh, leave him.- Thank you.- You're welcome.Oh, and, Alan, your machine,it had better bloody work.Hugh...I swear,I'm not a spy.Oh, for God's sake,of course you're not a bloody spy.- What?- Denniston gave me the Beale cipherand guess what? I cracked it."Ask, and it shall be given to you;seek and ye shall rind."Matthew 7:7. That was the key.Far too simple for the likes of you.Pity Denniston disagrees.Come in.Sir, I think I've got Turing.I tailed him to a pub last night wherehe meta bloke. Exchanged an envelope.So I follow this other fella,pick him up, gave him a good shake.- He's a poofter. He confessed.- What?The man admitted it. Arnold Murray.Hangs around that pub,men pay him for a go.Turing's one of the men that paid.Only Mr Murray herethen has the bright ideaof robbing Turing's house after,with a friend.That's what Turing's hiding.Well, he's a poof, not a spy.- No.- What's the matter?We can charge a university professorwith indecency.No, this is... It's bloody rubbish.Turing's up to something important.He's committed a crimeand he's broken the law.And with a bloke.Jesus Christ, it's bloody disgusting.This isn't the investigationI was conducting.Bring him in.Wait.Let me interrogate him. Please.Give me half an hour aloneand then I swear, I'll spendthe next month running errandson as many rubbish cases as you like.Fine.Now, will someone get me a warrantfor the arrest of Alan Turing?Alan?Christopher's simply notmoving fast enough.- We should talk.- And even with the diagonal board,he's still not eliminating settingsas quickly as we need him to...- I'm leaving.- But you've just walked in.No. No, Bletchley.- What?- It's my parents.I'm 25, I'm unmarried,I'm living alone and they want me home.That's just ridiculous.That's my parents.You... You can't leave. I won't let you."I'll miss you."That's what a normal personmight say in this situation.I don't care what is normal.What am I supposed to do, Alan?I... I will not give up my parents.You...You have an opportunity hereto make some actual use of your life.And end up like you? No, thanks.I'm sorry you're lonelybut Enigma will not save you.Can you decipher that,you fragile narcissist?Or would you like me to go and fetchyour precious Christopher to help?I'm sorry.I want you...I want you to stay because I like you.I like talking to you.I like talking to you, too, Alan.And what if you weren't alone?What if you had a husband?Do you have one in mind?I do.Hugh?Hugh's terribly attractive,I'll give you that,but I don't really thinkhe's the marrying Kind.No, I... I wasn't thinking of Hugh.Or Peter. Peter's so quiet.Oh, my God.- But this makes sense.- Did you just propose to me?Well, it is the logical thing to do.This is ridiculous.This is your parents.I can't believethat this is happening.Joan...Is your middle nameCaroline or Catherine?Elizabeth.Erm, Joan Elizabeth Clarke, erm...Will you marry me?it's beautiful.Well, I know it isn't ordinary but...Whoever loved ordinary?She had it in both hands.And she looked up at mewith her doe eyes and said,"Am I supposed to put that in my mouth?"And I said,"Yes, you know, the French way."So she pops it in,clamps her lips around it,and starts hummingthe bloody Marseillaise.- Come and have a dance,- No, no, no, no.You can dance with your fiancany time you like.Right now, this moment......my turn.What's the matter?What if...What if I don't fancy being with Joanin that way?Because you're a homosexual?I suspected.Well, should Itell herthat I've had affairs with men?You know, in my admittedlylimited experience,women tend to be a bit touchy aboutaccidentally marrying homosexuals.Perhaps not spreading this informationabout might be in your best interest.I care for her, I truly do. I...I... I just don't know if I can, erm...- pretend about...- You can't tell anyone, Alan.It's illegal.And Denniston is lookingfor any excuse he can to put you away.- I know.- This has to stay a secret.Come on, it's your turn.Ah, okay.It's a sport for girls!It's not a sport for girls!- Cup of tea?- No, thank you.Mr Turing, can I tell you a secret?I'm quite good with those.I'm here to help you.Oh, clearly.Can machines think?Oh, so you've read someof my published works?What makes you say that?Well, because I'm sittingin a police stationaccused of entreatinga young man to touch my penisand you just asked meif machines can think.Well, can they?Could machines ever thinkas human beings do?Most people say not.You're not most people.Well, the problem isyou're asking a stupid question.I am?Of course machinescan't think as people do.A machine is different from a person.Hence they think differently.The interesting question isjust because something,er, thinks differently from you,does that mean it's not thinking?Well, we allow for humans to havesuch divergences from one another.You like strawberries.I hate ice-skating.You cry at sad films.I am allergic to pollen.What is the pointof different tastes, different......preferences if not to saythat our brains work differently,that we think differently?And if we can saythat about one another,then why can't we saythe same thing for brainsbuilt of copper and wire, steel?And that's this big paper you wrote?What's it called?The Imitation Game.Right, that's... That's what it's about?Would you like to play?- Play?- It's a game.A test of sorts.For determining whether somethingis a...a machine or a human being.- How do I play?- Well, there's a judge and a subject.And the judge asks questionsand depending on the subject's answers,determines who he is talking with, er,what he is talking with and, um,all you have to dois ask me a question.What did you do during the war?I worked in a radio factory.What did you really do during the war?Are you paying attention?Damn it!We're soon out of time. Our month.So that's it, then, is it?Oh, the trouble is it doesn't matterhow much we improve it.The machine's nevergoing to be able to process159 million million millionpossibilities in time.It's just bloody hopeless.It's searching. It's just...It doesn't know what it's searching for.If we knew what the messageswere going to say...If we knew what the messageswere going to say,we wouldn't have to decrypt them at all.Who's Alan's friend?Hugh? He's a bit of a cad, actually.So my type, then?- Well, I'll introduce you.- No...He'll come over.- Are you sure?- Yes.I smiled at him 15 minutes agoand haven't looked back since.- Who's that with Joan?- Mmm?Er, Helen. Works with her.She's really pretty.She wants me to come over-What? How... How on earthcan you know that?She smiled at me a while backand she hasn't looked again since.And got him.Now, why is this, that whenI was single I found it very boring,but now that I'm engaged,I just rind it dreadfully fun?Bingo, she's in.Alan, introduce us.What? Why me?Because there's nothinglike a friend's engagementto make a woman want to dosomething she'll later regretwith the fianc'sbetter-looking chum. Let's go.Half a crown saysAlan bollockses this up entirely.No bet.- Alan Turing has a theory.- He has many.He believes that the regulationsagainst men and womenworking side by side are soundbecause such proximitywill necessarily lead to romance.- Er, what? No, I don't. I...- However, I disagree.- You do?- Yeah.I think that if I were workingbeside a woman all day long,I could appreciateher abilities and intellectwithout taking her to bed.I'm sorry, have we met?I don't recall.But let's assume we haven't.Helen Stewart, Hugh Alexander.So who do you agree with?Alan or myself?Well, Alan, of course.I'm very flattered really, but I...I don't think that...Rubbish.Well, I work beside a man every dayand I can't help but have developeda bit of a crush on him.Well, who is this man?So I can kick his arse.Oh, there's no need to worry,it's been chaste.We've never even met. He's a German.Now I really want to kill him.Er... How... How do you meanyou work alongside a German?Well, each of us intercepts messagesfrom a specific German radio tower.So we have a counterparton the other sidewho's tip-tapping out the messages.Everyone types a touch differently,so you get to knowthe rhythm of your counterpart.It's strangely intimate.I feel as if I know him so well.It's a pity he has a girlfriendbut that's why I disagreewith you, Mr Alexander,because I'm in lovewith a co-worker of sortsand we've never even met.Well, allow me to buy you another pintand I'll tell you why you're wrong.Let's.Excellent.Thanks.Erm... Pints and a sloe gin.In case you were wondering,that's what flirting looks like.Helen!- Alan!- Yes, Alan?Why do you think your Germancounterpart has a girlfriend?It's just a stupid joke.Don't worry about it.No, no, no, no, no. Tell me.Well, each of his messagesbegins with the same tive letters.C- I-L-L-Y.So I suspect that Cillymust be the name of his amore.But that's impossible.The Germans are instructed to usefive random lettersat the start of every message.Well, this bloke doesn't.Love will make a mando strange things, I suppose.In this case,love just lost Germanythe whole bloody war!- Oh!- Go, Peter.Sorry.Alan!Alan!- Whoa, whoa!- Stop!- No, no, no...- Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!Hugh Alexander. John Cairncross.Peter bloody Hilton.Alan?What..What... What if...What if Christopher doesn't have tosearch through all of the settings?What if he only has to search throughones that produce words we alreadyknow will be in the message?- Repeated words. Predictable words.- Exactly.Look. Look, like this one."0600 hours. Weather today is clear.Rain in the evening."Heil Hitler."Oh, that's it.Exactly.They send a weather reportevery day at 6:00 amSo that's... That's three words we...We know will bein every 6:00 am message.Er, "weather", obviously and...- Heil bloody Hitler?- Heil bloody Hitler!Here's the 6:00 messagefrom this morning.Hugh, the, er, the right-handletter wheels. Set them to...Yes, yes, I know."Weather" and "Hitler",- Peter, John.- Yes.Run voltages through those letters,through the back scramblersSo we'll use the loops?Yes.Joan, what was the last6:00 am. message?- L.- L.- H.- H.- W.- W.- A.- A.Q.Done.Come on. Come on, Christopher.Oh, my God.What... What happened?- Did it work?- Alan?Alan! Alan!I need a new message.The latest intercept.Thanks.E...O... T.- Ready?- Yes.- M.- M.- Y.- Y.- M.- M.- S.- S.- A.- A.- C,- C.- T.- T.- R.- R.- S.- S.- O.- O.- A.- A.- Y.- Y.- R.- R."KMS Jaguar ist aufpunkt... is directedto 53 degrees 24 minutes northand aufpunkt one degree west."Heil Hitler.Turns out that's the only Germanyou need to know to break Enigma.Yes!Come here.M.A.Y.- I.- I.T. R.R.- O.- T.T.A.A.H.H.Q,Q.U.U.R.My God, you did it.You just defeated Nazismwith a crossword puzzle.There are five peoplein the worldwho know the positionof every ship in the Atlantic.- They're all in this room.- Oh, good God.Oh, I don't think even He hasthe power that we do right now.No, there's going to be an attackon a British passenger convoy.- Right there.- Oh, God, you're right.All those U-boatsare only 20, 30 minutes away.Civilians. Hundreds of them.We can save their lives.I'll phone Denniston's office- so that he can alert the Admiralty.- No.Do you think there's enough timeto save them?There should be if we can geta message to that convoy.Commander Denniston's office, please.it's urgent.- No.- What the hell are you doing?You... You... You can't call Denniston.You... You can't tell himabout the attack.What are you talking about?We can have air supportover that convoy in 10 minutes.- Let the U-boat sink the convoy.- Look, it's been a big day,maybe you're sufferingfrom a bit of shock...- We don't have time for this.- No!- That's enough! That's enough!- Stop, Hugh!John, the attack is in minutes.Yes, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.I'm fine.Do you know whypeople like violence, Hugh?It's because it feels good.Sometimes we can't do what feels good.We have to do what is logical.What's logical?Hardest time to lie to somebodyis when they're expecting to be lied to.- Oh, God.- What?If someone's waiting for a lie,you can't just, er, give them one.Oh, damn it, Alan's right.What?What would the Germans thinkif we destroy their U-boats?Nothing. They'II be dead.No. No, you can't be right.So our convoy suddenly veers off course.A squadron of RAF bombersmiraculously descends onthe coordinates of the U-boats.What will the Germans think?The Germans will knowthat we have broken Enigma.They'Il stop all radiocommunications by middayand they'll have changedthe design of Enigma by the weekend.Yes.Two years' work.Everything that we've done here,it will all be for nothing.There are500 civilians in that convoy.Women, children.We're about to let them die.Ourjob is not to saveone passenger convoy,it is to win the war.- Ourjob was to crack Enigma.- Well, we've done that.Now for the hard part.- Keeping it a secret.- Carlisle.What?The convoy you're about to...It's, er...The HMS Carlisle is one of the ships.We can't act on everypiece of intelligence.So, fine, we won't.Just this one.Peter, what's the matter with you?My... My brother's...Well, he's on the Carlisle.A gunnery ensign.L.mI'm so sorry.Who the hell do you think you are?This... This is my brother.Look, he's my big brother, all right?And you have a few minutesto call off his murder.We can't.He's right.Alan...Joan...Hugh... John.Oh, please, I...The Germans, they won't get suspiciousjust because we stop one attack.No one will know.I'm asking you as your friend.Please.I'm so sorry.You're not God, Alan, you don'tget to decide who lives and who dies.Yes, we do.Why?Because no one else can.Why are you telling me this?We need your help to keep this a secretfrom Admiralty, Army, RAF.No one can know we broke Enigma.Not even Denniston.Who's in the processof having you fired.You can take care of that.While we develop a systemto help you determinehow much intelligence to act on.Which, er, attacks to stop,which to let through.Statistical analysis.The minimal number of actionsit would take for us to win the warbut the maximum number we can takebefore the Germans get suspicious.And you're going totrust all this to statistics?- To maths?- Correct.And then MIG can come up withthe lies that we tell everybody else.You'll need a believablealternative sourcefor all the piecesof information you use.A false story so that we can explainhow we got our informationthat has nothing to do with Enigma.And then you can leak thosestories to the, er, the Germans.And then to our own military.Maintain a conspiracy of liesat the highest levels of government?Sounds right up my alley.Alan, I so rarelyhave cause to say this,but you are exactly the manI always hoped you would be.They codenamed it Ultra.It became the largest storeof military intelligencein the history of the world.It was like having a tapon Himm/er's intercom.I- E-O...T- X-X...Secrecy becamethe primary concernand for some reason, they...They trusted me.Peter, do you have the, er...the 6:30 decrypt?it's a Beale cipherEncrypted with a phrase from a..."Ask, and it shall be givento you; seek and ye will End."Matthew 7.'7. That was the key.Peter will come around eventually.Jack?Could you give Alanand me a moment, please?The Soviets and us,we're on the same side.What I'm doing will help Britain.I have to tell Denniston.No, you don't.Because if you tell him my secret,I'll tell him yours.Do you know what they do to homosexuals?You'll never be able to work again.Never be able to teach.Your precious machine?I doubt you'll ever see him again.Hello. Can I...Um, speak to Stewart Menzies,please? it's urgent.One moment, please.Hello. Menzies.Some adviceabout keeping secrets./t's a lot easier if youdon't know them in the first place.Were they steaming my letters,tapping my telephone?Trailing my nervous walks?You know, I...I never did End out.Joan?Joan? What's...Oh. Whel'e'$ JOHN?Military prison.What have you done?Decoded Enigma intercepts.I found a pile of themin the bedside table.No, no. I... I gave those to herover a year agowhen I was trying to figure out- a link between...- I'm sure you did.Denniston's been lookingfor a Soviet spy.He's been looking inside Hut 8.I know who the spy is.It... It's not Joan. it's...It's Cairn cross.I... I found the Beale cipher,the Bible.God, I wish you'd been the spy.You'd be so much betterat this than he is.You knew it was him?Of course I bloody knew.I knew before he came to Bletchley.Why do you think I had him placed here?But we have an Enigma machine.Yes, Polish Intelligence smuggled...So what's the problem?You placed a...a Soviet agent at Bletchley Park?It's really quite useful to be able toleak whatever we want to Stalin.Churchill's too damn paranoid.He won't share a shredof intelligence with the Soviets.Not even information thatwill help them against the Germans.There's...so much secrecy.Cairncross has no ideawe knovm of course.He's rea/ly not the brightest bulb.Which is why I need your help.I want to know what to leak to John,what to feed to the Sovietsas well as the British.I'm not a... I'm not a spy. I'm...I'm just a mathematician.I Know a lot of spies, Alan.You've got more secretsthan the best of them.You... You have to promise methat you will release Joan.Yes, Joan's at the market.She's going to be backin an hour. I lied.I'd better hold on to these.If anybody finds out about them,prison will be the least of her worries.Oh, Alan,we're going to havesuch a wonderful war together.I need you to leave Bletchley.What?it's Menzies.I don't trust him-it's not safe here.Do you thinkit's any safer anywhere else?You need to get away.You need to get very far away from me.Alan, what's happened?We can't be engaged any more. You...Your parents need to take you backand find you a husband elsewhere.What's wrong with you?I have something, er, to tell you.L.mI'm a homosexual.- All right.- No, no. Men, Joan.- Not women.- So what?Well, I... I just told you.So what?I had my suspicions, I always did.But we're not like other people.We love each other in our own wayand we can have the life togetherthat we want.You... You won't be the perfect husband.Well, I can promise you, I harbourno intention of being the perfect wife.I'll not be fixing your lamb all daywhile you come home from the office.I'll work.You'll work.And we'll have each other's company.We'll have each other's minds.That sounds like a bettermarriage than most.Because I care for you.And you care for me.And we understandone another more than...More than anyone else ever has.I don't.- What?- Care for you.I never did.I... I just needed you to break Enigma.I've done that now, so... So you can go.I'm not going anywhere.I've spent entirely too much of my lifeworried about what you think of meor what my parents think of meor the boys in Hut 8or the girls in Hut 3.And do you know what? I'm done.This is the most importantwork I will ever doand no one is going to stop me,least of all you.Do you know what? They were right.Peter, Hugh, John.You really are a monster.The war dragged onfor two more solitary yearsand every day we performedour blood-soaked calculus.Every day we decidedwho lived and who died.Every day we helped the A/liesto victories and nobody knew.Stalingrad.The Ardenne. The invasion of Normandy.All victories that would nothave been possiblewithout the intelligencethat we supplied.And people talk about the waras this epic battlebetween civi/isations.Freedom versus tyranny.Democracy versus Nazism.Armies of millionsbleeding into the ground.Fleets of shipsweighing down the oceans.Planes dropping bombs from the skyuntil they obliterated the sun itselfThe war wasn't like that for us.For us it was just.- .Half a dozen crossword enthusiastsin a tiny villagein the South of England.your victory.It is the victoryof the cause of freedom in every land.This is a solemn but glorious hourI wish that Franklin D Roosevelthad lived to see this day.Was I God? No.Because God didn'twin the wanWe did.So what happens now?Is it back to university for us,Isuppose?Yes, pretty much.But you've one other thing left to dobefore your serviceto your government is concluded.- What's that?- Burn everything.Burn? Why?You were told when you startedthis was a top secret programme.Did you think we were joking?But the war is over.This war is.But there'Il be others.And we know how to break a codethat everybody elsebelieves is unbreakable.Precisely.Tear it down, light it up.Sweep away the ashes.None of you have ever met before.None of you have evereven heard the word "Enigma"Have a safe trip home.Behave.With a bit of luck,you'll never have to see meor one another againfor the rest of your lives.That's unbelievable.Now, Detective,you get to judge.So tell me,what am I?Am I a machine? Am I a person?Am I a war hero?Am I a criminal?I can't judge you-Well, then.You're no help to me at all.Come in.You wanted to see me, sir?Turing. Sit down.Is something the matter?You and Christopher Morcomare quite close.I wouldn't say that.Well, your mathematics teacher saysthe two of youare positively inseparable.We're the best students in the class.He caught you passingnotes the other day.Cryptography, to pass the time.The class is too simple.You and your friend solvemaths problems during maths classbecause the maths class is too dull?He's not my friend.- Well, I'm told he's your only friend.- Who said that?Something's come up concerning MorcomWhy am I here?Christopher is dead.I don't understand.His mother sent word this morning.The family were on holiday, you see.I don't understand.Well, he had bovine tuberculosis,as I'm sure he told you.So this won't come as a shockbut still, all the same, I'm sorry.You're mistaken.Did he not tell you?Well, he's been sick for a long time.He knew this was coming soon.But he had a stiff upper lip about it.Good lad.- Are you all right, Turing?- Yes. Of course.Like I said,I didn't know him very well.Ah, I see. Very well.May I leave, Headmaster?Congratulations, sir.Sorry.I would have come.I would have testified.And what would you have said?That I... I wasn't a homosexual?Alan, this is serious.They could send you to jail.Oh, damn it.- Your hands, you're twitching.- No. No, I'm not.- Alan.- Er...It's the medication.The medication?Well, the judge gave me, um, a choice-Either two years in prison orhorhormonal therapy.Oh, my God.- Oh, my God!- Yes, yes, that's right.Chemical castration.To, er, to cure me of my, um,homosexual predilectionsWell, of course I chose that.I mean, I couldn'twork in prison and...All right.Now, I'm going to speak to your doctors.- I'm going to speak to your lawyers.- I'm... I'm fine.- Please let me help you.- No, I...I don't need your help, thank you.Alan, you do not have to do this alone.I'm not alone.Never have been.Christopher's become so smart.If I don't continuemy treatment, then they'llThey'II take him away from me.You...You... You... You can't let themdo that. You can't.You... You can't let themleave me alone.I don't... I don't want to be alone.I don't want to be alone.All right, all right.All right.It's all right, come and sit down.t's all right. Come and sit down.It's all right.Oh, well...That's a much nicer ringthan the one I... I made you.Yes.His name's Jock.He's an army man,if you can believe it.We work together.Why don't we do a crossword puzzle?It'll only take us five minutes.Or in your case, six.There.Perhaps later.Yes, of course.You got what you wanted, didn't you?Work, a husband.Normal life.No one normal could have done that.Do you know, this morning,I was on a train that wentthrough a city that wouldn't existif it wasn't for you.I bought a ticket from a manwho would likely be deadif it wasn't for you.I read up on my work,a whole field of scientific inquirythat only exists because of you.Now, if you wishyou could have been normal,I can promise you, I do not.The world is an infinitely better placeprecisely because you weren't.Do you...Do you really think that?I thinkthat sometimes it is the peoplewho no one imagines anything ofwho do the thingsthat no one can imagine.
